**Strategic Acquisitions and Growth Initiatives:**
*   During the third fiscal quarter of 2025, Radiant Logistics completed three strategic acquisitions: Transcon Shipping Co. (March 2025), USA Logistics Services (April 2025), and Universal Logistics (May 2025). These acquisitions contributed to the significant EBITDA growth.
*   On September 2, 2025, Radiant Logistics announced the acquisition of an 80% ownership interest in Weport, S.A. de C.V., a Mexico-based company offering a full range of global transportation and logistics solutions. This includes international ocean and airfreight forwarding, multi-modal domestic services, customs brokerage, and warehousing. This acquisition aims to strengthen Radiant's North American presence and expand its footprint in Mexico. The acquisition structure involves partial upfront payments, with the remainder tied to integration milestones and future performance, and includes the right to purchase the remaining 20% stake. Weport will continue to operate under its current leadership and is expected to transition to the Radiant brand during 2026.

**Market Conditions and Outlook:**
*   Management acknowledged potential near-term challenges due to ongoing U.S. negotiations on trade and tariffs, estimating an impact on 25-30% of Q3 gross margins.
*   Despite these challenges, the company anticipates a subsequent "bullwhip effect" that could lead to a surge in global trade once disputes are resolved.
*   The company's diversified service portfolio and strong cash position are expected to provide buffers against potential disruptions.
*   Radiant Logistics is well-positioned to navigate the impacts of recently announced tariffs due to its low leverage and diversified service offering.
*   In its Q1 FY2025 earnings call (ended September 30, 2024), management noted expectations for soft market headwinds to persist into 2025, but also pointed to some positive trends, such as incremental project freight and tightening West Coast capacity.
