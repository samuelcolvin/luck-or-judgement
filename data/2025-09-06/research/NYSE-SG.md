Sweetgreen Inc. (SG) has been active with strategic initiatives and faced financial headwinds in the recent quarter, significantly impacting its outlook for the remainder of 2025.

**Recent Financial Performance and Outlook (Q2 2025)**

*   For the second fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2025, Sweetgreen reported total revenue of $185.6 million, a 0.5% increase year-over-year, but it missed analysts' expectations.
*   The company experienced a significant decline in same-store sales of 7.6% in Q2 2025, primarily due to a 10.1% drop in traffic, partially offset by a 2.5% menu price increase.
*   Sweetgreen posted a net loss of $23.2 million for Q2 2025, compared to a $14.5 million net loss in the prior year period. The GAAP EPS loss was $0.20, missing analyst estimates.
*   Restaurant-level profit margin decreased to 18.9% in Q2 2025, down from 22.5% in the prior year, attributed to sales deleverage and increased restaurant-level advertising spend, despite some labor optimization. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $6.4 million, about half of the previous year's figure.
*   Management attributed the challenging Q2 results to macroeconomic pressures, a tough comparison to the previous year's strong performance, and the transition of its loyalty program.
*   For fiscal year 2025, Sweetgreen updated its guidance, projecting at least 40 net new restaurant openings (with 20 featuring the Infinite Kitchen technology), revenue ranging from $700 million to $715 million, and negative same-store sales of 4% to 6%. The company anticipates a restaurant-level profit margin of approximately 17.5% and adjusted EBITDA between $10 million and $15 million.

**Strategic Initiatives and Operational Updates**

*   Sweetgreen continues its expansion strategy, planning to open at least 40 new restaurants in FY 2025, including entering new markets such as Arkansas, Sacramento, Phoenix, and Cincinnati.
*   A significant focus is on the "Infinite Kitchen" technology, which automates assembly lines and aims to reduce labor costs by 7 percentage points and improve COGS by 1 percentage point. Half of the planned 2025 new unit pipeline will feature this technology.
*   The company launched a new loyalty program, SG Rewards, in April 2025, which saw 20,000 new sign-ups weekly, and is expected to become neutral to positive in its impact later in the year after initially causing a headwind in Q2.
*   Sweetgreen is enhancing its menu innovation with seasonal items and lower-priced offerings, including the nationwide launch of Ripple Fries in March 2025 and a collaboration with COTE Korean Steakhouse for a KBBQ-inspired menu.
*   Operational efficiencies are being sought through AI-driven scheduling systems to optimize labor planning and improve shift coverage, with deployments across nearly half the fleet by the end of Q2 2025. Sweetgreen is also testing "Project Turbo" to improve throughput in traditional stores by leveraging both digital and front lines.

**Leadership Changes**

*   Sweetgreen announced the retirement of Mitch Reback, its Chief Financial Officer since 2015, effective September 21, 2025. Jamie McConnell, formerly of Chipotle, will succeed him as CFO, effective September 22, 2025.
*   The company also appointed Zipporah Allen as Chief Commercial Officer, effective September 2, 2025, to sharpen brand positioning, menu, and customer engagement.

**Analyst and Investor Sentiment**

*   Following the Q2 2025 earnings report, analysts updated their models, with some lowering price targets. The consensus rating for Sweetgreen among 15 Wall Street analysts is "Hold."
*   Sweetgreen's full-year revenue guidance for 2025 was revised downward from previous estimates.
*   Despite challenges, institutional investors have recently increased their positions in Sweetgreen, including Maverick Capital Ltd. and Durable Capital Partners LP, among others.
