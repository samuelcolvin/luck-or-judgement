Epsilon Energy Ltd. (EPSN) has had several notable events and financial updates that could influence its stock performance in the near term.

**Recent News and Events:**

*   **Dividend Announcement:** On September 5, 2025, Epsilon Energy Ltd. declared a dividend of $0.0625 per share, payable on September 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of September 15, 2025. All dividends paid by the company are considered "eligible dividends" under Canadian tax law.
*   **Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results:** Epsilon Energy reported its second-quarter 2025 earnings on August 13, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) of $0.07 fell short of the expected $0.11, and revenue of $11.62 million slightly missed the anticipated $11.8 million. Despite missing forecasts, year-over-year revenue grew by 59.1% to $11.62 million, and net income surged 90.2% to $1.55 million. However, cash flows experienced a 30% decline quarter-over-quarter, primarily attributed to lower realized oil and gas prices.

This acquisition adds 40,500 net acres in the core of the Powder River Basin (PRB) and contributes 2.2 MBoepd (56% oil, 44% gas) to production. Post-acquisition, the pro-forma Q2 2025 production stands at 47 MMcfe (77% natural gas, 22% oil). The consideration for this acquisition includes the issuance of 6 million Epsilon common shares and the assumption of an estimated $49 million in debt.
*   **Operational Capital Expenditures:** For the second quarter of 2025, capital expenditures amounted to $4 million. These expenditures were primarily for the drilling of one gross well (0.25 net) in Texas and the completion of one gross well (0.25 net) in the Garrington area of Alberta.
*   **Share Price Movement:** On August 15, 2025, the company's stock experienced a decrease of over 10%. The stock also fell by 4.04% on September 5, 2025.

Epsilon Energy anticipates a significant increase in proved reserves and liquids production by the end of 2024, driven by the recent acquisition in the Powder River Basin.
