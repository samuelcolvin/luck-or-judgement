Paysign, Inc. (PAYS) Performance Report

Paysign, Inc. reported its second quarter 2025 financial results on August 5, 2025, demonstrating significant year-over-year growth in key financial metrics. Total revenues for Q2 2025 reached $19.08 million, marking a 33.1% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. Net income surged by 99.1% to $1.39 million, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.02, up from $0.01 in the prior year, though it fell short of the estimated $0.04. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled, increasing by 101.8% to $4.51 million.

The company's performance was significantly driven by its pharma patient affordability segment, which saw revenue increase by 189.9% to $7.8 million, representing 40.6% of quarterly revenues. Paysign added seven new pharma patient affordability programs during the quarter, bringing the total to 97 active programs, and processed claims increased by over 80%. The average quarterly revenue per pharma program also notably increased to $79,937 from $43,851 in the same period last year.

Conversely, revenue from the plasma industry segment decreased by 4.7% to $10.7 million. This decline was primarily attributed to an industry-wide oversupply of plasma, which led to a decrease in average monthly revenue per plasma center to $7,098. Despite this, Paysign expanded its plasma center count by adding 123 net plasma centers, all of which became operational on June 16, 2025, bringing the total to 607 centers. The company also incurred approximately $300,000 in one-time expenses related to the onboarding of these new plasma centers.

Operationally, Paysign's gross profit margin improved by approximately nine percentage points to 61.6%. The company ended the quarter with $11.8 million in unrestricted cash and no bank debt. During Q2 2025, Paysign repurchased 100,000 shares of common stock and acquired the assets of Gamma Innovation LLC.

Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2025, Paysign expects total revenue to be between $19.5 million and $20.5 million. The company plans to open a new patient services contact center in Q3 2025 to support the growing demand for its pharma solutions, which is expected to quadruple its support capacity. Paysign anticipates adding an additional 30-40 pharma patient affordability programs by the end of 2025. For the full year 2025, Paysign raised its revenue guidance to up to $78.5 million and expects continued EPS growth. The company anticipates exiting Q3 2025 with approximately 595 plasma centers, following the addition of 9 and the reduction of 22 underperforming centers. Full-year gross profit margins are projected to be between 61.0% and 62.0%.
