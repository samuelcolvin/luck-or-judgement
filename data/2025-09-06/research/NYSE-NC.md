NACCO Industries, Inc. (NC) Performance Report:

NACCO Industries announced its Second Quarter 2025 financial results on August 6, 2025. The company reported revenues of $68.2 million, a 30% increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. Despite increased revenues, net income decreased to $3.3 million from $6.0 million in Q2 2024, and diluted earnings per share were $0.44, down from $0.81 in the prior year's second quarter. These results were partly influenced by increased other income and lower tax expenses, which were offset by lower operating results due to short-term operational challenges and a comparison against a strong Q2 2024.

Operational challenges in the Utility Coal Mining segment contributed to a year-over-year decrease in operating profit and Segment Adjusted EBITDA during Q2 2025. Specifically, lower operating results at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company, a slight reduction in earnings from unconsolidated operations, and higher operating expenses, primarily employee-related costs, were noted. Ongoing inefficiencies at a customer's power plant led to mining inefficiencies and increased mining costs at Mississippi Lignite Mining Company.

Looking ahead, NACCO Industries anticipates a substantial increase in consolidated operating profit during the second half of 2025. However, the company projects lower full-year 2025 results due to the impact of insurance income received in 2024. The Utility Coal Mining segment expects steady demand through the second half of 2025 and into 2026.

The company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2525, which is payable on September 15, 2025, to stockholders of record as of September 2, 2025. This follows an 11% dividend increase announced on May 15, 2025.

As of June 30, 2025, NACCO Industries had $7.8 million remaining under its $20 million share repurchase program, which is set to expire at the end of 2025. The company also plans to terminate its pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2025, which will result in a settlement charge. In Q2 2025, the company changed the names of its reportable segments to Utility Coal Mining, Contract Mining, and Minerals and Royalties, formerly Coal Mining, North American Mining, and Minerals Management, respectively, with no change to their composition or historical reporting. A Senior Vice President of the company sold 3,208 shares of stock on September 6, 2025. NACCO Industries participated in the 16th Annual Midwest Ideas Investor Conference on August 13, 2025.
