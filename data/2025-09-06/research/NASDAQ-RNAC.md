Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2025, were $14.9 million, an increase from $12.7 million in the same period in 2024, primarily due to costs associated with the Phase 3 AURORA trial.

This trial is designed to evaluate Descartes-08 versus placebo in approximately 100 participants.

For participants without prior biologic exposure, an average 7.1-point reduction was observed, and 57% maintained minimum symptom expression at Month 12. Descartes-08 is designed for outpatient administration without the need for preconditioning chemotherapy.
