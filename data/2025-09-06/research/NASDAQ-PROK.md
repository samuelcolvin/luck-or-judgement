ProKidney Corp. (NASDAQ: PROK) has released several significant updates recently, providing insights into its financial performance, clinical pipeline, and regulatory progress. These developments are particularly relevant for informing investment decisions over the coming quarter.

On August 12, 2025, ProKidney reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. The company announced an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.13, which surpassed the consensus estimate of -$0.14. Quarterly revenue was reported at $0.22 million, exceeding analysts' expectations of zero revenue for the period, although the amount remains minimal. The net loss before noncontrolling interest for Q2 2025 was $37.0 million, an improvement from a $38.5 million loss in the same period of the previous year. Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased to $25.9 million from $29.4 million year-over-year, mainly due to reduced costs from completed or terminated clinical studies, even as ongoing Phase 3 trials continued. General and administrative expenses saw a slight increase to $14.0 million from $13.7 million. ProKidney concluded the second quarter with $294.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is projected to support operations into mid-2027.

Significant clinical and regulatory milestones were also announced. In a July 2025 Type B meeting, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope is an acceptable surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval of rilparencel, ProKidney’s lead product candidate, in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The FDA also confirmed that the ongoing Phase 3 PROACT 1 study can serve as the basis for both accelerated and confirmatory approval of rilparencel. An effect size showing at least a 1.5 mL/min/1.73m² per year improvement in eGFR slope was deemed an acceptable demonstration of efficacy. Topline data from the PROACT 1 study to support an accelerated approval application is anticipated in the second quarter of 2027. More than half of the approximately 350 required patients for the accelerated approval analysis have already been enrolled in the Phase 3 PROACT 1 study.

Further positive news came on July 8, 2025, with the announcement of statistically and clinically significant topline results from the Phase 2 REGEN-007 study. Specifically, Group 1 (n=24), which mirrored the dosing schedule of the Phase 3 PROACT 1 study, demonstrated kidney function stabilization. The annual decline in eGFR slope improved by 78%, moving from -5.8 to -1.3 mL/min/1.73m², a result that was both statistically significant (p<0.001) and clinically meaningful. Full results from the REGEN-007 study are slated for submission as a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2025 Kidney Week in November.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2025, ProKidney completed a domestication process, changing its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware. The company is also scheduled to participate in two upcoming conferences in September: the Citi Biopharma Back to School Conference and the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference. The next estimated earnings report date for ProKidney is November 11, 2025.
