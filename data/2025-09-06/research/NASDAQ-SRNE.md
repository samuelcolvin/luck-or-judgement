Sorrento Therapeutics Inc. (SRNE) has been involved in significant bankruptcy proceedings and related legal developments that continue to impact the company.

Key recent developments include:

*   **Bankruptcy and Associated Litigation:** The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 13, 2023, and subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on April 10, 2024. However, the legal challenges related to the bankruptcy persist. On July 18, 2025, the liquidating trustee for Sorrento Therapeutics filed a lawsuit against former directors and officers in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The lawsuit alleges breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that executives approved a dividend of Scilex Holding Company (SCLX) stock to Sorrento shareholders while the company was insolvent and facing a $173 million arbitration judgment. The trustee is seeking damages equivalent to the value of the dividend, along with any losses incurred before and during the bankruptcy, and attorney's fees.
*   **Trading Restrictions on Common Stock:** The Committee overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings proposed trading restrictions on Sorrento's common stock (SRNE) through September 25, 2025. An emergency hearing regarding these restrictions was slated to occur by March 25, 2025. Earlier, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court had extended the lock-up period on the Scilex dividend stock until April 14, 2025, with previous extensions also noted. These restrictions imply continued oversight and control over the disposition of shares stemming from past corporate actions.
