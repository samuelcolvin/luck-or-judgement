Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) has recently experienced a mix of financial challenges and significant regulatory and legal developments that could influence its performance in the coming weeks.

**Financial Performance (Q2 2025)**
Vanda Pharmaceuticals reported its second-quarter 2025 financial results on July 31, 2025. The company announced a GAAP net loss of $27.2 million for the quarter, which was a larger loss compared to the $4.5 million net loss in the second quarter of 2024. Diluted net loss per share for Q2 2025 was $0.46, missing analyst estimates of $0.34. For the first six months of 2025, the net loss totaled $56.7 million. Quarterly revenue was $52.6 million, marking a 4% increase from the prior year, but it fell short of the consensus estimate of $54.77 million. Research and development costs saw a significant increase, climbing 32% to $21.99 million in Q2 2025, primarily due to active pipeline projects. Vanda ended Q2 2025 with $325.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, a decrease of $15.4 million from March 31, 2025. The company has reaffirmed its 2025 financial guidance, expecting total revenues to range from $210 million to $250 million and year-end cash to be between $280 million and $320 million.

**Legal and Regulatory Developments**
Vanda Pharmaceuticals has been actively involved in several legal and regulatory challenges with the FDA.
*   **HETLIOZ (Jet Lag Indication):** On August 18, 2025, a federal appeals court overturned the FDA's decision to deny approval of Hetlioz for jet lag disorder. The court found that Vanda's expert evidence was "specific, reasoned, and rooted in evidence," while the FDA's review was "cursory." The case has been remanded back to the FDA, which must either approve the application or provide Vanda with a hearing. Additionally, on August 21, 2025, Vanda sought FDA Commissioner Review regarding a decision to uphold approval of two generic versions of Hetlioz.
*   **Tradipitant (Gastroparesis):** Vanda filed a lawsuit against the FDA on April 23, 2025, alleging an unlawful delay by the agency in scheduling a hearing to discuss the rejection of tradipitant as a gastroparesis treatment in September 2024. Vanda argued that the hearing should have been scheduled by May 7, 2025.
*   **FDA Approval Timelines:** On May 29, 2025, a D.C. federal judge indicated a readiness to rule in Vanda's favor concerning its challenge to the FDA's drug approval timelines. The judge suggested that the FDA might have established an unlawful regulatory framework that circumvents the 180-day deadline for new drug applications. The court encouraged both parties to negotiate a resolution.
*   **HHS Request for Information:** On July 14, 2025, Vanda submitted a public response to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Request for Information (RFI). Vanda's response proposed that the FDA repeal what it considers to be unlawful regulations that delay drug approvals and also eliminate mandated animal testing.
