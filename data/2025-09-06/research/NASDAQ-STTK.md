Shattuck Labs, Inc. (STTK) has seen several significant developments in its clinical pipeline and financial standing, particularly impacting its lead drug candidate, SL-325, a potential first-in-class DR3 blocking antibody for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

**Key Developments and Upcoming Milestones:**

*   **Strategic Pipeline Shift:** Shattuck Labs has discontinued its clinical program for SL-172154, previously evaluated for TP53 mutant AML and higher-risk MDS, due to interim data showing only modest improvements that did not meet expectations for clear clinical benefit. The company is now focusing its resources on the development of SL-325.
*   **SL-325 Regulatory and Clinical Progress:**
    *   An Investigational New Drug (IND) application for SL-325 was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2025.
    *   The IND for SL-325 became effective for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease on August 21, 2025, allowing the company to proceed with clinical trials.
    *   Shattuck Labs expects to initiate the Phase 1 clinical trial for SL-325 in healthy volunteers during the third quarter of 2025.
    *   The Phase 1 trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses.
    *   Dosing of the first participant in the single-ascending dose (SAD) portion of the trial is anticipated in the third quarter of 2025, with the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2025.
    *   Enrollment for both the SAD and MAD portions of the Phase 1 clinical trial is projected to be completed in the second quarter of 2026.
    *   Preclinical data for SL-325 has shown high affinity binding to human DR3, potent inhibition of TL1A binding to DR3, and a favorable safety profile in non-human primate studies, as well as full receptor occupancy.
*   **Preclinical Pipeline:** The company plans to nominate a lead DR3 bispecific development candidate from its preclinical pipeline in the second half of 2025.

**Financial Position:**

The initial proceeds were approximately $46 million, with potential additional proceeds of $57 million from warrant exercises. This capital infusion is expected to fund the company's operations into 2029, including multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for SL-325.
