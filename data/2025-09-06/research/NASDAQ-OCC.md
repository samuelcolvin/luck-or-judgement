On July 7, 2025, Optical Cable Corporation announced a strategic collaboration with Lightera, LLC. This collaboration aims to expand product offerings and solutions, particularly within the data center and enterprise sectors. Lightera specializes in optical fiber and connectivity solutions. This strategic move is anticipated to significantly broaden OCC's opportunities in these markets, accelerate sales growth, and generate value for the company. While the company sees positive industry trends in military and smaller data center markets, it has not yet fully capitalized on the hyperscale data center market, which represents a growth opportunity. OCC does not provide forward-looking revenue guidance.
