Arcutis Biotherapeutics Inc. (ARQT) has experienced several significant developments and anticipates key events that could influence its performance over the next quarter.

**Recent Developments (June 2025 - September 2025):**

*   **ZORYVE Foam Approval and Launch:** The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZORYVE (roflumilast) topical foam 0.3% on May 22, 2025, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older. Sales of the foam formulation commenced in June 2025.
*   **Q2 2025 Financial Results:** On August 6, 2025, Arcutis reported net product revenue of $81.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, representing a 164% increase year-over-year and a 28% increase quarter-over-quarter. The company's net loss per share also narrowed. ZORYVE demand contributed significantly to this growth, with prescriptions surpassing 1 million since launch.
*   **ZORYVE Recognition and Guidelines:** In June 2025, ZORYVE cream and foam received the Seal of Recognition from the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF), marking the first time a prescription product has been recognized by the NPF. Additionally, ZORYVE cream 0.15% received a strong recommendation in updated American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines for adult atopic dermatitis treatments.
*   **Pipeline Updates:** Arcutis submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for ARQ-234, a potential biologic treatment for atopic dermatitis. However, the development of ARQ-255 for alopecia areata was halted due to insufficient efficacy.
*   **Patent Grants:** Arcutis obtained three new U.S. patents in Q2 2025 related to topical roflumilast compositions.
*   **Conference Participation:** Arcutis presented at Citi's Biopharma Back to School Conference on September 3, 2025, discussing its strategic vision and progress.

**Upcoming Key Events (September 2025 - December 2025):**

*   **PDUFA Date for ZORYVE Cream (Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis):** The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of October 13, 2025, for the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for ZORYVE cream 0.05% for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children aged 2 to 5 years old.
*   **sNDA Submission for ZORYVE Cream (Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis):** On September 3, 2025, Arcutis submitted an sNDA to the FDA to expand the indication of ZORYVE (roflumilast) cream 0.3% for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in children down to the age of 2. If approved, this would make ZORYVE the first topical PDE4 inhibitor indicated for plaque psoriasis in this younger age group.
*   **Q3 2025 Earnings Release:** Arcutis' third-quarter 2025 earnings release is projected for November 4, 2025, with another source estimating November 5, 2025. While Q3 is expected to show higher net sales than Q2, the company anticipates a moderation in the pace of growth due to typical seasonal impacts in the topical market before returning to a more robust trajectory in Q4.
*   **Additional Clinical Study:** A Phase 2 study has been initiated to evaluate ZORYVE cream 0.05% in infants (3 months to less than 2 years) with atopic dermatitis.
*   **Future Financial Goal:** Arcutis aims to achieve cash flow breakeven by 2026.
