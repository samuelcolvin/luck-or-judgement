McCoy Global Inc. (MCCRF) has been active with financial disclosures and corporate actions that may impact its stock performance in the near term.

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results (August 8, 2025):**
    *   Total revenue increased by 21% to $24.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to $19.9 million in the second quarter of 2024.
    *   SmartProduct revenue, a key growth area, accounted for 58% of total revenue, rising by 117% or $7.5 million from the comparative period.
    *   Net earnings decreased by 56% to $1.4 million, down from $3.1 million in Q2 2024. This decrease was primarily attributed to higher stock-based compensation expense ($1.4 million) due to the mark-to-market impact of share price appreciation on cash-settled awards, and provisions for bad debts ($0.5 million).
    *   Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million, or 20% of revenue, compared with $4.7 million, or 24% of revenue, in Q2 2024.
    *   The company reported $6.6 million in net cash as of June 30, 2025, with an additional $12.1 million available under undrawn credit facilities.
    *   Booked backlog stood at $24.6 million as of June 30, 2025, an increase from $22.3 million in Q2 2024.
    *   McCoy Global declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per common share, payable on October 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2025.

*   **Digital Technology and Contracts:**
    *   The company has advanced its Digital Technology Roadmap, successfully concluding in-field trials for its innovative smarTR™ system for land and shelf applications.
    *   These trials led to $11.0 million in contract awards for smarTR™ system hardware, with additional potential for the included equipment award.
    *   The smarTR™ system also received a Spotlight on New Technology Award at OTC 2025.

*   **Share Repurchase Program (August 20, 2025):**
    *   McCoy Global Inc. announced approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange for a normal course issuer bid to repurchase up to 2,537,833 common shares, representing 9.48% of its issued share capital.
    *   The program is valid from August 22, 2025, until August 21, 2026, or an earlier completion date.
    *   Management and the Board believe the current market price does not reflect the underlying value of the Corporation, making repurchases a desirable use of funds.

*   **Outlook:**
    *   Management indicated that Q3 2025 might show tempered sequential revenue and earnings growth.
    *   This is due to the timing of National Oil Company (NOC) contract announcements and continued weakness in the North American land market.
    *   However, the $24.6 million backlog and growing adoption of smartProduct technology are expected to provide a solid foundation for the remainder of 2025.
