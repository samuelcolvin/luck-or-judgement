Hippo Holdings Inc. has undergone several significant developments and reported key financial results that may influence its stock performance in the coming quarter.

**Recent Financial Performance and Outlook**

*   **Q2 2025 Results**: Hippo reported its second-quarter 2025 financial results on August 6, 2025. The company achieved positive net income from operating activities for the first time, with a net income attributable to Hippo of $1 million, compared to a net loss of $40 million in Q2 of the previous year. Adjusted net income reached $17 million, up from an adjusted net loss of $20 million in Q2 of last year. Revenue grew by 31% year-over-year to $117 million, driven by an increase in gross earned premium and higher premium retention. Gross Written Premium (GWP) increased by 16% year-over-year to $299 million. The consolidated net loss ratio improved significantly by 46 percentage points year-over-year to 47%, attributed to underwriting and rate actions, enhanced claims operations, and favorable reserve releases. Fixed expenses (Sales & Marketing, Technology & Development, General & Administrative) decreased by $6 million year-over-year, and as a percentage of revenue, these costs dropped from 46% in Q2 2024 to 30% in Q2 2025. Cash and investments, excluding restricted cash, increased by $76 million quarter-over-quarter to $604 million, primarily due to a $50 million surplus note issuance.
*   **Updated 2025 Guidance**: Following the Q2 results, Hippo revised its full-year 2025 guidance. The company now expects full-year 2025 revenue to be between $460 million and $465 million. The net income outlook for full-year 2025 has been raised to between $35 million and $39 million (from a previous loss guidance of $65 million to $69 million), driven by improved net loss ratio trends and a one-time gain from the sale of homebuilder distribution assets. Adjusted net income guidance for full-year 2025 has also been raised to between a $4 million loss and breakeven. The consolidated net loss ratio guidance for 2025 has improved to between 67% and 69%. Gross written premium guidance for 2025 was raised to between $1.07 billion and $1.1 billion.

**Strategic Partnerships and Divestitures**

*   **Strategic Partnership with The Baldwin Group**: On June 12, 2025, Hippo announced a strategic partnership with The Baldwin Group. This partnership aims to triple Hippo's access to new construction homebuyers by distributing its new construction homeowners product through Baldwin's Westwood Insurance Agency, which partners with 20 of the top 25 homebuilders in the U.S.
*   **Sale of Homebuilder Distribution Network**: As part of the partnership with The Baldwin Group, Hippo agreed to sell its homebuilder distribution network to Baldwin for $100 million. This deal closed on July 1, 2025, with $75 million in upfront cash and $25 million to be paid in Q1 2026. This divestiture is expected to lower revenue in Q3 and Q4 by approximately $5.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, compared to prior guidance, but is anticipated to result in a gain of approximately $90 million in Q3 2025 on consolidated financial statements. The additional capital from this sale is intended to fuel Hippo's long-term strategy of building a balanced portfolio of insurance risks.
*   **Investor Day 2025**: During its Investor Day on June 12, 2025, Hippo outlined its go-forward strategy and introduced 2028 financial targets, including over $2 billion in gross written premium, more than $125 million in adjusted net income, and an adjusted return on equity exceeding 18%.
*   **Sale of First Connect Stake**: In late October 2024, Hippo finalized the sale of a majority stake in its subsidiary, First Connect Insurance Services, to Centana Growth Partners for approximately $48 million, retaining a 19.2% stake.
