Simulations Plus, Inc. (SLP) has experienced several significant developments during the last quarter, impacting its financial performance and operations.

On July 14, 2025, Simulations Plus reported its third quarter fiscal 2025 financial results for the period ending May 31, 2025. The company announced a 10% increase in total revenue to $20.4 million, with software revenue growing 6% to $12.6 million and services revenue increasing 17% to $7.7 million. Despite revenue growth, Simulations Plus reported a net loss of $67.3 million and a diluted loss per share of $3.35. This loss was primarily attributed to a one-time non-cash impairment charge of $77.2 million, which was taken to align the book value of assets, related to prior acquisitions, with their current market value. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $7.4 million, representing 37% of total revenue. However, organic revenue declined by 4%, mainly due to lower revenue from its Quantitative Systems Pharmacology/Toxicology (QSP/QST) software and biosimulation services. The company also noted a decline in software renewal rates, with account renewals falling to 84% from 93% in the prior year's third quarter, and fee renewal rates dropping to 71% from 86%. Following these results, Simulations Plus revised its full-year 2025 guidance downward, citing delays in service bookings and uncertainty in the biopharma funding environment. During the third quarter, the company also implemented a strategic reorganization, transitioning from a business unit structure to a functionally-driven operating model.

In relation to its financial reporting, Simulations Plus had appointed Grant Thornton LLP as its new auditor on April 15, 2025. However, on July 15, 2025, the day after its Q3 earnings report, the company announced the dismissal of Grant Thornton LLP. Grant Thornton subsequently stated that concerns they raised regarding segment reporting, reporting unit determinations, and internal controls were not resolved to their satisfaction, publicly disagreeing with Simulations Plus's characterization of the dismissal. This series of events led to several law firms, including Rosen Law Firm, Kaplan Fox, Hagens Berman, and Johnson Fistel, initiating investigations into potential securities violations related to the company's asset valuations and the auditor dismissal.

Other notable developments include an investment of $1 million in Nurocor, a clinical development technology company, announced on July 14, 2025. This investment is part of Simulations Plus's Corporate Development Initiative, which was launched in 2024 to support early-stage technology companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, on July 29, 2025, Simulations Plus and the Institute of Medical Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences announced successful results in validating ADMET PredictorÂ® models with enhanced AI Drug Design. The company is also investing in AI-driven initiatives, planning AI integrations into products like GastroPlus later in the year. Simulations Plus is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences in September 2025, including the Wells Fargo Healthcare and Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare conferences.
