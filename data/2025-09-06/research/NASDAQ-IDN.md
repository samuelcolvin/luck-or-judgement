This agreement extends the bank's use of Intellicheck's identity validation technology to include teller workstation transactions across more than 1,900 branches nationwide. The initial Annual Contract Value (ACV) is expected to be in the low-seven figures, with additional contracted revenue anticipated to begin in Q3 2025.

*   **Strategic Focus and Efficiency:**
    *   The company successfully completed its migration to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which is expected to result in annual savings exceeding $300,000.
    *   Intellicheck integrated with Ping Identity's PingOne DaVinci, a no-code identity orchestration service, on June 4, 2025, broadening access to its identity verification technology.
    *   There has been a strategic shift towards high-margin verticals, including automotive and title insurance, which offer higher pricing per scan compared to retail.
    *   The banking and lending sector represented approximately 38% of Q2 revenue and saw an 85% year-over-year growth, which helped offset declines in other segments.

*   **Higher Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses increased by 10% to $4.9 million in Q2 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, partly due to a rise in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.

*   **Customer Concentration:** In 2024, the top 10 clients accounted for 71% of the company's revenue, presenting a concentration risk, although diversification efforts are underway.
