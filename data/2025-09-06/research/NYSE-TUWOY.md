Tullow Oil PLC (TUWOY) has seen significant developments in its operations, leadership, and financial positioning that could influence its performance over the coming quarter.

Key updates include:

*   **Leadership Transition:** Ian Perks was appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tullow Oil, effective September 15, 2025. Richard Miller, who served as Interim CEO, will return to his role as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Perks has stated that his immediate priority is to establish a "long-term sustainable financial footing" for the company before pursuing growth across Africa.
*   **Ghana Drilling Operations:** The company's Ghana drilling program, utilizing the Noble Venturer rig, commenced in May 2025. Two new Jubilee wells, one producer and one water injector, are anticipated to come onstream in the third quarter of 2025. The first well drilled in Jubilee in 2025 reportedly yielded "better than expected net pay." This two-year drilling program aims to enhance oil production and operational efficiency. Following planned maintenance, the Noble Venturer drillship is scheduled to resume drilling activities for Tullow at the beginning of 2026.
*   **Production and Operational Efficiency:** In Q1 2025, Tullow's production stood at 52,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), including 7,100 boepd of gas production. This figure was within expectations despite a two-week planned maintenance shutdown on the Jubilee field. Average facility uptime across the Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) units in Ghana remained high at 97%, with a combined average production rate of approximately 44.1 kbopd net. However, production from the Jubilee field, averaging around 87 kbopd gross (33.9 kbopd net), was affected by issues with the J69 producer well, water injection communication, and increased water cut in certain wells. Maintenance activities in Q1 2025 aimed to upgrade power supply reliability and water injection consistency for the FPSO. A 4D seismic survey across the Jubilee and TEN fields, completed in Q1 2025, is currently being analyzed to optimize the 2025-26 drilling program and identify future well locations. Shearwater secured a contract for Ghana's first deepwater seismic survey at the Jubilee and TEN fields on August 27, 2025.
*   **Financial and Strategic Initiatives:** In January 2025, Tullow successfully resolved a significant tax dispute, being cleared of a $320 million Ghana Branch Profits Remittance Tax (BPRT) assessment and confirming no future exposure to this tax under its Petroleum Agreements. This resolution removed a "material overhang" from the business. The company's strategy for 2025 includes focusing on cost efficiency and production optimization. A key financial goal for 2025 is the refinancing of upcoming debt maturities to strengthen the balance sheet. Tullow anticipates generating approximately $200 million in free cash flow in 2025, assuming an $80/bbl oil price, which includes about $50 million in overdue gas receipts from Ghana from 2024. The sale of Gabonese assets is also progressing, with a closing expected around mid-2025.
*   **Short Interest Activity:** As of August 15, 2025, short interest in TUWOY experienced a substantial increase of 120.2% from July 31, 2025, reaching 698,400 shares. The short-interest ratio is currently 1.4 days, based on average daily trading volume.
