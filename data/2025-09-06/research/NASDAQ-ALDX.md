Aldeyra Therapeutics Inc. has experienced several significant developments during the last quarter that could impact its stock performance. The company reported its Q2 2025 earnings on August 7, 2025, with an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.16, surpassing analysts' consensus estimates of -$0.21. The next earnings report is estimated for November 6, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, Aldeyra held $101 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

A key focus for the company is its investigational drug candidate, reproxalap, for the treatment of dry eye disease. On July 17, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review Aldeyra's resubmitted New Drug Application (NDA) for topical ocular reproxalap, assigning a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 16, 2025. This resubmission followed a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA in April 2025, which cited methodological issues and the need for an additional symptom trial to demonstrate efficacy. Subsequently, in May 2025, Aldeyra announced that reproxalap achieved the primary endpoint in a Phase 3 dry eye chamber trial, demonstrating statistical superiority to vehicle in reducing ocular discomfort. This positive data was included in the resubmitted NDA. While a related dry eye disease field trial did not reach statistical significance, it is expected to be submitted as supportive data. AbbVie has an existing option agreement for reproxalap, which includes potential milestone payments to Aldeyra upon FDA approval.

Another significant drug candidate, ADX-2191, has received important regulatory designations. On August 19, 2025, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to ADX-2191 for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a condition with no currently approved treatments for most forms. A planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial for ADX-2191 in retinitis pigmentosa is anticipated to begin in 2025. Furthermore, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted Orphan Drug Designation for ADX-2191 for inherited retinal dystrophies, including retinitis pigmentosa, on July 24, 2025, and for primary large B-Cell lymphomas on August 28, 2025. On June 26, 2025, Aldeyra also announced receipt of a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) Agreement Letter from the FDA for ADX-2191 for the treatment of primary vitreoretinal lymphoma. The clinical trial outlined in the SPA is expected to commence in the second half of 2025 and conclude in 2026.

Looking ahead, Aldeyra Therapeutics' President and CEO is scheduled to participate in a fireside chat at the H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference on September 8, 2025.
