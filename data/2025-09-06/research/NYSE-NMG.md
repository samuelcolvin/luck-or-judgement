Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (NMG) is progressing with its key projects, focusing on the development of its integrated Phase-2 operations, comprising the Matawinie Mine and the Bécancour Battery Material Plant. The company continues to advance towards a Final Investment Decision (FID) for these projects through ongoing technical development, financing activities, and commercial engagements with customers.

**Key Developments and Project Status:**

*   **Phase-2 Projects:** NMG is actively working on aligning engineering, construction, and procurement preparations with project financing activities to reach FID for the Phase-2 Matawinie Mine. Engineering for the Phase-2 Bécancour Battery Material Plant is also progressing, with support from specialized Asian firms and partnering facilities for large-scale testing, also in anticipation of FID.
*   **Feasibility Study:** An Updated Technical Feasibility Study Report for the integrated Phase-2 operations (Matawinie Mine and Bécancour Battery Material Plant) was issued on March 25, 2025. This study confirmed the technical and economic viability of the project, indicating an after-tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 17.5% and a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$1,053 million. Upon a positive FID, the Phase-2 Matawinie Mine and Bécancour Battery Material Plant could achieve commercial production within less than three years.
*   **Financing:** As of June 11, 2025, NMG received over US$1 billion in Letters of Interest for its project debt financing. In December 2024, the company closed an aggregate US$50 million private placement, with funding provided by the Canada Growth Fund and Investissement Québec. This investment is specifically aimed at supporting detailed engineering, procurement of long-lead equipment, and critical-path activities for the Phase-2 projects.
*   **Phase-1 Operations:** The company has initiated the decommissioning of its Phase-1 Purification Plant due to technology changes and lease expiry. However, the remaining Phase-1 operations located in Saint-Michel-des-Saints continue to operate, producing flake concentrate from the Matawinie deposit and preparing large-scale qualifying active anode material samples for customers.
*   **Phase-3 Expansion:** NMG acquired the Lac Guéret graphite deposit (Uatnan Mining Project) in January 2024, which is intended to underpin the company's planned Phase-3 expansion. A preliminary economic assessment for this project targets a production of approximately 500,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate per annum over a 24-year life of mine.

**Market and Trade Dynamics:**

*   **U.S. Duties on Chinese Graphite:** Preliminary affirmative determinations by the U.S. Department of Commerce in July 2025 regarding its anti-dumping and countervailing duties investigation of active anode material from China resulted in combined duties of up to 160%. This is expected to improve the competitiveness of North American producers like NMG. A final determination on these duties is anticipated in December 2025.
*   **EV and Energy Storage Market:** Global electric vehicle (EV) adoption remains strong, with a 28% increase. Energy storage is emerging as a significant growth driver, partly due to rising demand from artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers. Anchor customer General Motors (GM) was the second-largest EV manufacturer in the U.S., with sales up 104% in the first half of 2025, and held the top position in Canadian EV sales with a 38% year-over-year increase as of July 2025. Panasonic Energy, another anchor customer, inaugurated its De Soto plant in July 2025, targeting full production by year-end and a 50% local supply chain integration. The global battery production pipeline remains robust at 9,275 GWh as of July 2025.

**Operational and ESG Performance:**

*   As of August 15, 2025, NMG reported a period-end cash position of $73.5 million. The company maintained a twelve-month rolling Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) of 2.82 at its facilities and 0 for contractors, with no major environmental incidents. NMG also published its 2024 ESG Report, highlighting its commitment to sustainable practices.
