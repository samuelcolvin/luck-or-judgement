International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (THM) has recently provided updates on its Livengood Gold Project and corporate activities that may influence its stock performance over the next quarter.

**Livengood Gold Project Developments:**
*   **Antimony Metallurgical Study:** The company announced encouraging initial results from the first phase of a metallurgical study on antimony mineralization at its Livengood Gold Project on September 4, 2025. This study commenced in March 2025 and focuses on 54 veins of massive stibnite, which have shown antimony grades up to 6.9%. The initial testing revealed that antimony is carried by stibnite, and most particles are of floatable size with good liberation at a p80 250 micron grind size. The next phase of work will determine flotation response and concentrate characteristics to assess economic viability. While the Livengood project already contains 9.0 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves within a 13.6 million ounce resource (with 6.4 million ounces of gold production projected over 21 years), the potential for recoverable antimony could enhance the project's overall value.
*   **2025 Work Program:** International Tower Hill Mines approved a $3.7 million work program for the Livengood Gold Project in 2025. This program is designed to advance the metallurgical study of stibnite antimony mineralization, progress baseline environmental data collection essential for future permitting, and continue community engagement efforts.

**Corporate and Financial Updates:**
*   **Private Placement:** On March 4, 2025, the company completed a non-brokered private placement, raising US$3.9 million. This involved issuing 8,192,031 common shares at US$0.4801 per share to existing major shareholders, representing approximately 4.1% of previously outstanding shares. These funds are intended to partially support the antimony study.
*   **Financial Filings:** International Tower Hill Mines filed its unaudited first quarter financial statements for the period ending March 31, 2025, along with its Management Discussion and Analysis and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The company also filed its 2025 Second Quarter Financial Results on August 8, 2025, and its 2024 Year End Financial Results around March 12, 2025.
*   **Annual General Meeting:** The 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders was held on June 4, 2025. During the meeting, shareholders elected six directors and reappointed the company's auditors, with over 98% support for all director nominees. The executive compensation plan also received approval with 98.45% support.
