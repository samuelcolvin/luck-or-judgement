Byrna Technologies Inc. has reported significant financial growth and operational advancements in the most recent fiscal quarters, with details on its Q2 2025 results and preliminary Q3 2025 figures.

**Financial Performance:**

*   **Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 (ended May 31, 2025):** Byrna Technologies announced its Q2 2025 financial results on July 10, 2025. The company reported record net revenue of $28.5 million, marking a 41% increase year-over-year from $20.3 million in Q2 2024. Gross profit for the quarter was $17.6 million, maintaining a 62% gross margin, up from $12.6 million in the prior year. Operating expenses increased to $14.2 million from $10.6 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher variable selling expenses, payroll costs, and increased discretionary marketing spend. Net income for Q2 2025 was $2.4 million, an increase from $2.1 million in Q2 2024. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $4.3 million, up from $2.8 million in Q2 2024. As of May 31, 2025, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $13 million, a decrease from $25.7 million at November 30, 2024, attributed to a planned increase in inventory for new product launches and seasonal working capital movements. Inventory totaled $32.3 million at May 31, 2025, compared to $20 million at November 30, 2024. The company reported no current or long-term debt.
*   **Preliminary Fiscal Third Quarter 2025 (ended August 31, 2025):** On September 4, 2025, Byrna Technologies announced preliminary unaudited revenue for Q3 2025. The company expects total revenue to be $28.2 million, a 35% increase from $20.9 million in fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was largely driven by strong dealer and chain store sales, with year-over-year gains observed across all business segments, despite the third quarter typically being a seasonally lighter period for personal security products. Full financial results for Q3 2025 are anticipated in October.

**Operational Highlights and Recent Developments (June - September 2025):**

*   **New Product Launch:** The Byrna Compact Launcher (CL) was launched in May 2025 and became available for purchase on Amazon, featured in Amazon's Prime Day sales event from July 8-11, 2025. The CL, which is 38% smaller than the flagship Byrna SD, contributed significantly to the revenue growth.
*   **Retail Expansion and Sales Growth:** Byrna continued to expand its "store-within-a-store" concept with Sportsman's Warehouse, operating in 12 stores by July 2025, with plans for an additional 10 stores in Q3. Dealer sales saw a 106% increase. The company's own retail locations averaged $69,000 in sales during May, with the Scottsdale location quickly reaching sales levels comparable to the established Las Vegas store. Byrna projects its products to be in over 500 retail chain locations by the end of August 2025 (Q3 2025) and more than 800 big-box locations by fiscal year-end 2025 (November 30, 2025), representing a 177% increase in 12 months.
*   **E-commerce Performance:** Amazon Prime Day sales (July 8-11, 2025) increased 28% year-over-year, and Byrna.com sales during the July 4th promotional period rose 18%. Amazon's share of Byrna's online sales reached 34% in Q3 2025 to date, up from 27% at the end of Q2 2025.
*   **Marketing Initiatives:** Byrna added Tucker Carlson as a celebrity influencer to amplify brand awareness and promote less-lethal solutions. The company also integrated AI tools into its content production, which led to a 50% surge in average daily web visits following the launch of a new AI advertising process as of August 25, 2025.
*   **Production and Domestic Sourcing:** The company has adjusted its production to a steady pace of 15,000 units per month to align with demand. Earlier in Q1 2025, Byrna increased its launcher production capacity to 24,000 per month and began producing payload ammo rounds at its Fort Wayne facility, aiming for 8 million rounds per year. The company has also achieved 92% U.S.-made components for its Byrna SD model as part of its "Made in America" initiative.
