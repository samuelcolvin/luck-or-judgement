Spero Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SPRO) has experienced several key developments within the last quarter that could influence its stock performance, primarily centered around its lead drug candidate, tebipenem HBr, and changes in its corporate structure.

*   **Tebipenem HBr Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway:**
    *   In May 2025, Spero Therapeutics and its partner GSK announced that the Phase 3 PIVOT-PO trial for tebipenem HBr, an investigational oral antibiotic for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), was stopped early due to achieving its efficacy endpoints. The trial demonstrated non-inferiority compared to intravenous imipenem-cilastatin in hospitalized adult patients.
    *   No new safety concerns were identified during the trial.
    *   Spero, in collaboration with GSK, plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for tebipenem HBr to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2025.
    *   If approved, tebipenem HBr is expected to be the first oral carbapenem for cUTI, with approval anticipated in mid-2026.
    *   The agreement with GSK stipulates that Spero is eligible to receive significant milestone payments upon NDA submission and initial commercial sales, with potential for up to $175 million in milestones over the 12 months following approval, in addition to future sales-based milestones totaling $225 million and tiered royalties. GSK will assume commercialization responsibilities.

*   **SPR720 Program Status:**
    *   A planned interim analysis of the Phase 2a proof-of-concept study for SPR720, aimed at treating non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), in October 2024 indicated that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint.
    *   The interim analysis also revealed potential dose-limiting safety issues, including reversible grade 3 hepatotoxicity.
    *   Consequently, Spero suspended the current development program for SPR720 and is evaluating alternative pathways for the program. This decision led to a workforce reduction of approximately 39%.

*   **Leadership and Corporate Governance:**
    *   Effective January 10, 2025, Esther Rajavelu was appointed Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Sath Shukla, who took voluntary paid administrative leave. Frank Thomas was appointed Chairman of the Board, replacing Ankit Mahadevia.
    *   These leadership changes were implemented in response to a "Wells Notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning certain public disclosures made by the company in 2022. Both Mr. Shukla and Dr. Mahadevia remain Board members and are cooperating with the SEC.
    *   Esther Rajavelu was also elected to the Board of Directors at Spero's 2025 annual meeting of stockholders and continues to hold the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer roles.

*   **Financial Update (Q2 2025):**
    *   For the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, Spero reported a net loss of $1.7 million, a significant reduction from a net loss of $17.9 million in the second quarter of 2024.
    *   Total revenue increased to $14.2 million in Q2 2025, up from $10.2 million in Q2 2024, primarily driven by collaboration revenue from GSK.
    *   As of June 30, 2025, the company's cash and cash equivalents stood at $31.2 million. Spero estimates that its existing cash, combined with earned and non-contingent development milestone payments from GSK (including a $23.8 million payment received in August 2025), will provide a cash runway into 2028.

*   **Previous Legal Matter:**
    *   A federal court dismissed a class action lawsuit filed by investors against Spero Therapeutics concerning prior statements related to the clinical trial and FDA approval prospects of tebipenem HBr. The court found that investors failed to adequately demonstrate fraudulent intent on the part of the company and its leadership.
