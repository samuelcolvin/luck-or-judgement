TruBridge, Inc. (NASDAQ: TBRG) has experienced several notable events and updates that could influence its stock performance in the near term.

The company announced its second quarter 2025 earnings on August 7, 2025, with a conference call held on August 8, 2025. While earnings per share (EPS) exceeded analyst expectations, revenues lagged behind projections. Following these results, TruBridge, Inc. revised its earnings guidance for the full year 2025.

In early August 2025, a "new major risk" related to revenue and earnings growth was identified. Analysts have also adjusted their outlooks, with Stephens cutting its target price for TBRG to $20 from $28 on August 12, 2025. Similarly, another analysis maintained a "Hold" rating while cutting its target price to $19.5 on August 11, 2025. Despite these adjustments, the company holds a consensus rating of "Moderate Buy," based on two buy and two hold ratings. However, there has been no research coverage from analysts in the past 90 days as of August 2025.

TruBridge re-established its partnership with Jackson Parish Hospital on August 4, 2025, a move expected to enhance financial performance and outcomes for the hospital. Additionally, the integration of Microsoft Dragon Copilot with TruBridge's Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform was highlighted around August 8, 2025. This integration is anticipated to expand the user base and drive high-margin revenue, although some analysts note that AI capabilities are becoming a baseline expectation in healthcare IT and may not ensure long-term competitive differentiation without further innovation. On July 30, 2025, TruBridge championed rural and community health through a national interoperability initiative.

Recent insider activity includes David Harse, the General Manager of Patient Care, selling 1,744 shares of TruBridge, Inc. stock on August 15, 2025. This transaction, along with other recent insider sales, has drawn scrutiny.

On July 3, 2025, TruBridge, Inc. was dropped from the Russell 3000 Index. The company participated in the Truist Securities Healthcare Disruptors & Digital Health Conference on June 25, 2025, and the Stifel 2025 Cross Sector Insight Conference on June 4, 2025. As of March 2025, TruBridge had transitioned approximately 30% of its Financial Health Complete Business Office (CBO) client base offshore. However, there are concerns about the retention of around 60 key CBO customers due for renewal within the next 24 months. Bookings for the fourth quarter of 2024 were lower than anticipated, with some deals being delayed into 2025.
