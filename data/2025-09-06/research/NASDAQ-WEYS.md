Weyco Group, Inc. (WEYS) faced significant challenges in the second quarter of 2025, primarily due to a slowdown in consumer spending and the impact of incremental tariffs.

**Q2 2025 Performance (results announced August 5, 2025):**
*   Net sales decreased by 9% to $58.2 million compared to $63.9 million in Q2 2024.
*   Gross earnings were 43.3% of net sales, a decline from 43.9% in the prior year.
*   Earnings from operations fell by 42% to $3.9 million.
*   Net earnings dropped by 60% to $2.3 million.
*   Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.24, down from $0.59 in Q2 2024.

**Key Factors and Events:**
*   **Consumer Spending & Retailer Caution:** A general slowdown in consumer spending amid economic uncertainty led retailers to adopt a more cautious approach to buying and inventory management.
*   **Tariff Impact:** New reciprocal and retaliatory tariffs enacted by the U.S. government negatively affected gross margins.
    *   The incremental tariff on goods sourced from China, which accounts for most of Weyco Group's product sourcing, peaked at 145% in April 2025. It was then temporarily reduced to 30% for a 90-day period ending August 12, 2025, with uncertainty remaining about future changes to this tariff.
    *   Additional tariffs on non-China imports were 10% and were projected to increase to 19-25% in August 2025.
*   **Brand Performance:** In the North American Wholesale segment for Q2 2025, sales were down across most major brands: Nunn Bush (-11%), Stacy Adams (-10%), Florsheim (-5%), and BOGS (-14%). The retail segment's net sales also decreased by 11% due to lower consumer demand on e-commerce websites, particularly for Florsheim and Stacy Adams.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** To counter these challenges, Weyco Group has undertaken efforts to diversify its manufacturing base by shifting production out of China to countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and India. The company also implemented measures like pre-purchasing inventory, negotiating supplier cost reductions, and increasing U.S. selling prices effective July 1, 2025.
*   **Dividend Announcement:** On August 5, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share, payable on September 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 18, 2025. This represents an increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share.
*   **Share Repurchases:** In the first half of 2025, the company utilized $3.1 million for share repurchases.
*   **Outlook:** Management anticipates that the challenging market environment will likely continue through the third and fourth quarters of 2025. They expressed cautious optimism for the BOGS brand in the second half of the year.
