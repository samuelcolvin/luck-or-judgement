Cadiz Inc. (CDZI) has reported several significant developments in 2025 concerning its water infrastructure projects, financial activities, and strategic partnerships.

**Water Infrastructure and Development:**
*   Cadiz Inc. is actively working on its Northern Pipeline and Southern Pipeline projects, with targeted completion dates by the end of 2026 and end of 2027, respectively.
*   In Q1 2025, the company secured 180 miles of steel pipe from the Keystone XL project, strategically avoiding a 25% steel import tariff increase. This acquisition is expected to mitigate potential project cost risks.
*   The Mojave Groundwater Bank project, an $800 million initiative announced in October 2024, involves repurposing 180 miles of Keystone XL pipelines. This 350-mile system is designed to transport 2.5 million acre-feet of water annually and create 1 million acre-feet of underground storage capacity.
*   The company expects reimbursements of $15-20 million for development expenses and additional payments of $25 million for Northern Pipeline assets and $51 million for water storage rights.

**Financial and Capital Activities:**
*   In Q1 2025, Cadiz successfully raised $20 million in equity, with net proceeds of $18.3 million, to cover 2025 capital costs and development expenses.
*   A $20 million registered direct offering of common stock occurred around March 10, 2025, with proceeds intended for the development of the Mojave Groundwater Bank project, including equipment and materials for pipeline construction beginning in 2025.
*   The company declared quarterly cash dividends for Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 on its 8.875% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. The Q1 dividend was paid on April 15, 2025, and the Q2 dividend was paid on July 15, 2025.

**Strategic Partnerships and Business Expansion:**
*   On September 5, 2025, Cadiz Inc., through its subsidiary ATEC Water Systems, formed a strategic partnership with San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District and Fontana Water Company (FWC) to address perchlorate contamination in the Rialto-Colton Groundwater Basin. This initiative, part of the Cactus Basins Recharge Program, leverages a 200,000 acre-foot water supply agreement signed between FWC and Cadiz in 2024.
*   The ATEC division has doubled its production capacity and demonstrated strong growth in water filtration technology markets, with a 90% win rate on water treatment bids and 38% growth in planning stage opportunities. ATEC Systems, acquired in 2022, also offers new PFAS filtration technology.
*   Cadiz Ranch is being expanded for potential hydrogen production facilities and data center developments. A second Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for hydrogen-solar development at Cadiz Ranch was signed on June 20, 2025.

**Publicity and Investor Relations:**
