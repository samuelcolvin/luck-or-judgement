**Clinical Program Updates (PBFT02 for FTD-GRN):**

*   **uPLiFT-D Study Progress:** The company completed dosing of Cohort 2 in its upliFT-D study for frontotemporal dementia with progranulin mutations (FTD-GRN) in July 2025.
*   **Interim Data from PBFT02:** Updated interim data released on August 12, 2025, showed that PBFT02 continued to demonstrate robust and durable elevation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) progranulin (PGRN) levels through 18 months post-treatment. The data also indicated improvement in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a disease progression biomarker, compared to natural history studies.
*   **Dose 2 Evaluation:** The first patient treated with Dose 2 PBFT02 (50% of Dose 1) showed a substantial increase in CSF PGRN levels at one month post-treatment, approaching the upper limit of a healthy adult reference range.
*   **Protocol Amendments and Future Enrollment:** Passage Bio submitted an amended upliFT-D study protocol to global trial sites and health authorities. The revisions include a short course of low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation due to serious adverse reactions (SAEs) related to blood clot formation observed in three of eight treated patients, which were assessed as possibly treatment-related. The amended protocol also modifies inclusion criteria to allow enrollment of patients earlier in disease progression, including those who are prodromal or have mild cognitive impairment, and excludes more severely progressed patients. Following acceptance of the amended protocol, the company plans to begin enrollment of Cohort 3 (FTD-GRN) and Cohort 4 (FTD-C9orf72), both of which will continue to evaluate Dose 2 PBFT02.

**Upcoming Milestones:**

*   **Regulatory Feedback (Manufacturing):** Passage Bio plans to seek regulatory feedback on its suspension-based manufacturing process comparability in the second half of 2025.
*   **Interim Data (Dose 2):** Updated interim safety and biomarker data from Dose 2 are anticipated in the first half of 2026.
*   **Regulatory Feedback (Trial Design):** The company expects to seek regulatory feedback on the registrational trial design for FTD-GRN in the first half of 2026.
*   **Conference Participation:** Passage Bio is scheduled to participate in the H.C. Wainwright 27th Annual Global Investment Conference on August 28, 2025.
