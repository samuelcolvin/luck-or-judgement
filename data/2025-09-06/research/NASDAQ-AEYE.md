AudioEye Inc. (AEYE) has demonstrated continued revenue growth and strategic expansion, alongside facing challenges related to legacy service churn.

**Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

*   AudioEye reported record second-quarter 2025 results on August 7, 2025, marking its 38th consecutive quarter of growth. Total revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $9.9 million, with gross profit at $7.6 million.
*   The net loss for Q2 2025 was $0.0 million, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million in Q2 2024, representing a significant reduction of 99.7%.
*   Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2025 was $1.9 million, up from $1.5 million in the same prior-year period.
*   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) reached $38.2 million as of June 30, 2025, an increase from $37.1 million as of March 31, 2025.
*   The company's customer base was approximately 120,000 as of Q2 2025.
*   For Q3 2025, AudioEye projects revenue between $10.2 million and $10.4 million and adjusted EBITDA between $2.2 million and $2.4 million.
*   AudioEye updated its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to between $40.3 million and $40.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA to between $8.9 million and $9.1 million. This updated guidance reflects the phase-out of certain legacy customers from previous acquisitions, which is expected to cause churn impacting ARR and revenue for 2025, though this process should be complete by year-end.

**Strategic Developments and Partnerships:**

*   On April 1, 2025, AudioEye announced a new $20 million loan facility with Bridge Bank, which includes a $12 million term loan, a $3 million revolver, and a $5 million delayed draw term loan for potential acquisitions. This facility reduces the interest rate from their previous loan.
*   AudioEye is expanding its presence in the European Union, capitalizing on the newly enacted European Accessibility Act. This expansion is expected to drive significant demand, with the European sales pipeline tripling from Q2 to Q3 2025.
*   On August 13, 2025, Motability Operations, which manages the Motability Scheme in the UK, selected AudioEye to enhance the accessibility and compliance of its digital platforms.
*   The company is integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its operations to improve accuracy and margins.
*   In March 2025, AudioEye released its 2025 Digital Accessibility Index, which analyzed 15,000 websites and found an average of 297 accessibility issues per page, an eightfold increase from 2023, largely due to improved testing capabilities.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

*   Gross profit margins temporarily decreased in Q2 2025 due to customer migration to an upgraded platform, with similar margins anticipated for Q3.
*   Operating expenses increased by approximately 2% year-over-year in Q2 2025, primarily due to higher selling, marketing, and stock compensation expenses.
*   The company acknowledges an increase in digital accessibility lawsuits, which could affect future demand and revenue.
*   AudioEye has reported losses for 14 consecutive years, highlighting a need for sustained profitability despite narrowing net losses.
*   While a new product, Accessibility Protection Status, was launched in November 2024, its immediate financial impact was deemed unclear at the time as it was a gradual rollout to existing customers.
