Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. (PKOH) Performance Report

Park-Ohio Holdings Corp. reported mixed financial results for the second quarter of 2025 (Q2 2025), which ended June 30, 2025.

**Recent Financial Performance (Q2 2025 - reported August 6-8, 2025):**
*   Net sales from continuing operations were $400.1 million, a 7.5% decrease compared to Q2 2024, and missed analyst estimates by 1.3%.
*   GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) from continuing operations was $0.67, representing a 10% increase from Q1 2025, but a decrease from $0.98 in Q2 2024.
*   Adjusted EPS was $0.75, an increase of 14% sequentially from Q1 2025, and beat analyst estimates by 4.9%. However, this was lower than the $1.02 reported in Q2 2024.
*   EBITDA was $35.2 million, up from $33.9 million in Q1 2025, and exceeded analyst estimates by 3.8%.
*   Gross margin expanded to 17.0% in Q2 2025, up from 16.8% in the previous quarter.
*   Operating cash flow was negative $14 million.

**Segment Performance (Q2 2025):**
*   **Supply Technologies** segment net sales declined to $187 million from $203 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to lower customer demand in certain North American industrial markets. Growth in the electrical and semiconductor sectors partially offset this decline.
*   **Assembly Components** segment net sales decreased to $95 million from $103 million in Q2 2024, attributed to lower unit volumes in fuel rail and extruded rubber products, customer delays on new business launches, and the expiration of favorable pricing on some legacy programs. Lower automotive production also affected this segment.
*   **Engineered Products** segment net sales were $118 million, down from $127 million in Q2 2024. This decline was mainly driven by lower sales in the forged and machined products group, lower railcar demand, and the impact of a facility closure from 2024. Despite this, the segment achieved record quarterly bookings of $85 million in new capital equipment, including a significant $47 million order. The segment's backlog increased by 19% from year-end to $172 million as of June 30, 2025. Demand for Engineered Products is being supported by sustained investment in defense, infrastructure, and electrical steel capacity expansion.

**Outlook and Guidance (as of August 2025):**
*   Park-Ohio lowered its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion, a 0.9% decrease at the midpoint from previous estimates.
*   Full-year 2025 Adjusted EPS guidance was also lowered to a range of $2.90 to $3.20 per diluted share, representing a 6.2% decrease at the midpoint.
*   The company expects free cash flow for fiscal year 2025 to be between $20 million and $30 million, with approximately $65 million anticipated in the second half of 2025.
*   The recent refinancing of senior notes is expected to increase interest expense in the second half of 2025, potentially reducing Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.20 per diluted share.

**Key Recent Developments:**
*   On July 17, 2025, Park-Ohio announced an offering of $350 million in senior secured notes due 2030, with proceeds intended to redeem its outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027.
*   The company also amended its revolving credit facility to extend its maturity date by five years, enhancing liquidity and extending maturities.
