Travelzoo Inc. (TZOO) Performance Report

Travelzoo Inc. (TZOO) reported its second-quarter 2025 financial results on July 23, 2025, for the period ending June 30, 2025. The company's revenue for Q2 2025 reached $23.9 million, marking a 13% increase year-over-year and surpassing analyst estimates of $23.3888 million. This revenue growth was primarily driven by gains in membership within North America and from Jack's Flight Club.

However, the company's profitability saw a notable decline. Travelzoo's GAAP earnings per share (EPS) for Q2 2025 was $0.12, falling short of consensus expectations of $0.236 or $0.24, representing a 50% negative surprise. Net income decreased by 49.3% to $1.48 million from $2.92 million in the prior year's quarter. The GAAP operating profit for the company was $2.1 million, a decrease from the previous year, which management attributed to increased investments in member growth and marketing. The non-GAAP operating profit stood at $2.4 million.

The North America segment's revenue grew by 14% to $16.1 million, but its operating margin declined due to higher marketing investments. In Europe, revenue increased by 7% to $6.4 million, but the segment experienced a loss, mainly due to increased spending on acquiring new Club Members. Conversely, Jack's Flight Club demonstrated strong performance, with revenue growing by 33% to $1.4 million and premium subscriber numbers rising by 15% year-over-year, achieving an operating profit.

Travelzoo's strategic focus on its membership model is evident, with membership fees contributing $3.0 million to Q2 2025 revenue, accounting for 12.5% of total revenue. Management anticipates this segment to contribute 25% of total revenue in the coming year. The company's U.S. Club Member acquisition cost averages $38, which generates $40 in membership fees and an additional $18 in transaction revenue within a quarter, indicating a 168% return on investment. As of 2024, Travelzoo's Club Offers had driven a 14.5% year-over-year membership increase, with 95% of its 30 million global members now being paying subscribers.
