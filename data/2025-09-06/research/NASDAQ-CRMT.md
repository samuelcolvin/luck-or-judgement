*   **Customer and Collection Initiatives:** The company has made strategic investments in technology, including upgrading its "Pay Your Way" platform.

*   **Impact of Tariffs:** Analysts have noted that tariff-related supply issues are impacting vehicle prices and affordability, which in turn affect inventory levels and transaction volumes.
