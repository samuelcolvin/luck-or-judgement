Nano Dimension Ltd. (NNDM) has undergone significant changes and announced key developments that may impact its performance over the next quarter.

**Strategic Business Developments and Acquisitions:**
*   Nano Dimension completed the acquisition of Markforged for $116 million on April 25, 2025. This acquisition is aimed at enhancing Nano Dimension's capabilities in AI-driven manufacturing and expanding its presence in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical technology. Markforged's products, software, and team are currently being integrated into Nano Dimension's operations.
*   Previously, Nano Dimension finalized its acquisition of Desktop Metal on April 2, 2025, for $179.3 million, following a Delaware Court of Chancery ruling on March 24, 2025, that compelled Nano Dimension to proceed with the merger despite initial resistance. However, on July 28, 2025, Nano Dimension issued a statement regarding Desktop Metal's bankruptcy and its strategic decision not to acquire Desktop Metal's assets. Desktop Metal had initiated an independent strategic assessment on April 21, 2025, to address its liabilities and liquidity issues.
*   Following these acquisitions, Nano Dimension is shifting its focus from aggressive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to strategic integration and long-term profitability. The company launched a comprehensive strategic assessment on March 26, 2025, focusing on its core business and recent acquisitions. As part of this strategy, Nano Dimension aims to achieve $20 million in annualized cost savings from Q4 2025 onwards by discontinuing underperforming product lines, including Admatec and Fabrica.

**Financial Performance:**
*   For the first quarter ended March 31, 2025, Nano Dimension reported core business revenue of $14.4 million, an 8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024.
*   The total cost of revenues for Q1 2025 was $8.5 million, up from $7.2 million in Q1 2024.
*   Research and Development (R&D) expenses decreased to $5.0 million in Q1 2025 from $9.1 million in Q1 2024. Sales and Marketing (S&M) expenses also saw a reduction, from $6.5 million in Q1 2024 to $5.5 million in Q1 2025. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses significantly decreased to $3.5 million from $9.6 million in Q1 2024.
*   The adjusted gross margin for Q1 2025 was 43.8%, a decrease from 49.8% in Q1 2024, primarily due to the discontinuation of non-strategic assets.
*   The adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed to $9 million in Q1 2025 from $13.6 million in the prior year, reflecting improved operational performance.
*   The company expects to release its Q3 2025 earnings around November 18, 2025.

**Leadership and Product Developments:**
*   Ofir Baharav was appointed as the new CEO in April 2025. Additionally, Assaf Zipori, previously Markforged's CFO, became Nano Dimension's new CFO on April 24, 2025. The company also strengthened its board with new technology and growth experts on June 11, 2025.
