Neurogene Inc. (NGNE) has provided several key updates related to its clinical programs, financial position, and corporate activities in recent months.

**Clinical Program Updates:**
*   Neurogene has completed dosing in its Phase 1/2 trial for NGN-401, a gene therapy for Rett syndrome.
*   The company has received agreement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the key elements of the registrational Embolden™ trial for NGN-401.
*   Initiation activities for the Embolden™ trial are currently underway.
*   The Embolden™ trial is designed to evaluate NGN-401 in females with Rett syndrome aged 3 years and older, with a primary endpoint at 12 months. The proposed sample size is 20 participants.
*   Neurogene remains on track to report updated clinical efficacy and safety data from the Phase 1/2 trial of NGN-401 in the second half of 2025.
*   Previously, positive interim clinical data from participants dosed with 1E15 vg of NGN-401 showed consistent improvements across multiple domains in Q3 2024.
*   There has been no evidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or hyperinflammatory syndrome reported in any participant at the 1E15 vg dose level of NGN-401.

**Financial and Corporate Updates:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, Neurogene reported cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $274.5 million.
*   The company anticipates that its current cash position provides a runway into early 2028. This updated runway from Q1 2025's projection into H2 2027 is partly due to a reallocation of capital from pipeline development to support pivotal trial activities for NGN-401.
*   For the second quarter of 2025, Neurogene reported a net loss of $22.0 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses for Q2 2025 were $19.4 million, an increase from $15.7 million in Q2 2024, primarily driven by Rett syndrome clinical trial costs and R&D headcount. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $6.7 million for Q2 2025, compared to $5.3 million in Q2 2024, influenced by employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and increased headcount.
