Climb Global Solutions Inc. (CLMB) has reported significant developments and strong financial performance in recent months, which may influence its stock performance.

In the second quarter of 2025, ending June 30, Climb Global Solutions reported net sales of $159.3 million, marking a 73% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Net income for the quarter also rose by 74% to $6.0 million, or $1.30 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 64% to $11.4 million. The company's gross billings grew 39% to $500.6 million. These strong results, released on July 30, 2025, exceeded analyst expectations, with an EPS of $1.39 against a consensus of $0.90, and revenue exceeding expectations by over $46 million. Management attributed this performance to double-digit organic growth, strengthened customer relationships, new vendor partnerships, and expanded market share in the U.S. and Europe. The acquisition of Douglas Stewart Software & Services (DSS) also contributed to this growth, particularly within the education sector. Climb Global Solutions declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share on July 29, 2025, payable on August 15, 2025.
