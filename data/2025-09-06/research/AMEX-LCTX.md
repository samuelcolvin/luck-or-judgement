On August 4, 2025, the first chronic patient in this new clinical study was treated for subacute and chronic spinal cord injury, marking the successful first-in-human use of a new parenchymal spinal delivery system. Previous clinical trials (a Phase 1 trial with over 13 years of follow-up and a Phase 1/2a trial with over 7 years of monitoring) have shown no unexpected serious adverse events.
